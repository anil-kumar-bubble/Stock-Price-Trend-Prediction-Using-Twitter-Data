<i>In today's interconnected digital world, social media platforms like Twitter have become valuable sources of information that can influence stock markets. This project aims to leverage the power of natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to analyze Twitter data related to stock market trends, particularly focusing on a specific stock symbol (e.g., 'RELI' for RELIANCE.).</i>
<b>Embeddings that are close to each other — just as Seattle and Vancouver have latitude and longitude values close to each other and comparable populations — can be considered similar. Using embeddings, an algorithm can suggest a relevant TV show, find similar locations, or identify which words are likely to be used together or similar to each other, as in language models.</b>
